# factorio_benchmarking_mods
A collection of mods to streamline Factorio benchmarking.

### car-optimizer
Sets cars to inactive if there's no driver and they're not on a belt. Unreleased.

### creative-world-plus
An empty world for design testing. Includes a map-gen preset for quickly turning everything off too.

### logger
Makes a log to factorio-current.log every game tick. However with only 0.001 sec resolution this probably won't be useful for you.

### old-recipe
Minimal mod to revert some of the 0.17 recipies back to their 0.16 counterparts. I recommend using [Old Version Simulator](https://gitlab.com/RustyBlade64/factorio-old-version-simulator/tree/017-update) instead.

### region-cloner
Essentially takes the vanilla editor cloning functionality and adds some fixes and enhancements.

### region-cloner-legacy
A 0.16 compatible reimplementation of the editor cloning functionality. Will fix issues if they arise until 0.17 stabilizes.
